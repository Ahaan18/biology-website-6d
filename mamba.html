              <h4>About black mamba</h4>  
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
              <p class="font17px">A black mamba <i>(Dendroaspis polylepis)</i> is a species of the mamba snakes group. It is known for its size, quickness and extremely strong venom. It is usually found in Africa and is considered the most dangerous snake of the continent. The average black mamba is about 2-2.5 meters long and can go up to 4.3 meters. The color of this snake isnt black, instead it ranges from grey to dark brown. This snake is multicelluar, eukaryotic, lacking a cell wall and are heterotrophic meaning it can't produce its own food and need to rely on external sources to get food. The black mamba is generally shy and nervous and will use its incredible speed to escape threats. It is not that important because it is responsible for lots of human deaths and is considered the deadliest snake of Africa.</p>
              <h4>Facts:</h4>
              <p class="font17px"><b>1. </b>If the mamba is concerned, it will rear up and threaten with its open mouth</p>
              <p class="font17px"><b>2. </b>Its venom is so strong that it is possible that one or two drops of it can easily kill most humans. Even though most bites are fatal, it is responsible for only a small number of deaths.</p>
