              <h4>About siberian tiger</h4>  
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
              <p class="font17px">The siberian tiger or Amur tiger <i>(Panthera tigris altaica)</i> is a species of cat which usually lives in eastern Russia's birch forests. It is considered to be the largest cat in the world with an average size of about 11 feet with its tail being 3 feet in length! They are easily distinguishable by their striped fur. They are multicellular organisms and all cells of the siberian tiger are of eukaryotic cell type. They are very important for the terrestrial ecosystem and a keystone species. As top predators, they keep check of the population of prey species which maintains the balance between herbivores and the vegetation upon which they feed.</p>
              <h4>Facts:</h4>
              <p class="font17px"><b>1. </b>Siberian tigers are solitary animals, meaning they mark their scent on trees to keep other tigers away.</p>
              <p class="font17px"><b>2. </b>Siberian tigers roam around and hunt often. They stalk their prey which can be elk, boar, bears and deer until they are close enough to kill. When done, they drag their kill to a sheltered and private area before they start to eat it.</p>

              <h4>Its habitat</h4>  
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
              <p class="font17px">The siberian tiger usually lives in eastern Russia's birch forests, but a few exist in China and North Korea. Their habitat is currently under threat because of deforestation and their habitat sadly have very high deforestation rates.</p>

              <h4>Movement:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">Siberian tigers show locomotive movement and walk on 4 legs. They roam around and hunt for prey. They move slowly because their legs are heavy.</p>
              <h4>Respiration:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">Siberian tigers have an organ called a Jacobson organ in the roof of their mouth. It is like a pouch-like structure. It has 2 small openings that direct scent particles from the air as the siberian tiger inhales to nerves located within the Jacobson organ structure.</p>
              <h4>Sensitivity:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">Siberian tigers have a well developed touch system and eyes. They use touch to navigate in darkness, detect danger and attack prey. They have forward-facing eyes. This provides binocular vision as their eyes overlap to create a 3D image. This enables them to accurately assessdistances and depth which is extremely useful to stalk prey easily.</p>
              <h4>Growth:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">Adult male siberian tigers grow upto 11 feet long and weigh upto 272 kg! Females can grow upto 9 feet long and weigh upto 168 kg.</p>
              <h4>Reproduction:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">Siberian tigers do sexual reproduction. First, females give birth to litters of 2 to 6 little cubs which they raise using very little or no help from the male tiger.</p>
              <h4>Excretion:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">The siberian tiger excretes nitrogen waste as urea. They have 2 kidneys and behave similarly to humans.</p>
              <h4>Nutrition:</h4>
              <p class="font17px">Siberian tigers are heterotrophs which means they cant make their own food and need external sources for food. The siberian tiger's favourite foods include elk, deer, wild boar, lynx and bear. They also eat fish, rabbits and smaller rodents when larger prey are less.</p>
